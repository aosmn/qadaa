These prayers may be too many that we don't know how to keep track of them, or how to calculate how many they are. That's why we created the Qadaa Prayers app. If you have missed prayers for a long period of time, you can use our app to calculate how many prayers you have missed, set a daily target and keep track of your prayers. Let's start the make up journey now"
